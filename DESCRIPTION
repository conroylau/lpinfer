Description: This package provides a set of methods for estimation and 
    statistical inference on the solutions (optimal values) of linear programs.
    The motivation is partially identified models. Identified sets in many 
    partially identified models can be characterized by the solutions to two 
    linear programs (one min, one max), with the interval between comprising 
    the whole identified set. The module is designed with this situation as 
    the primary use-case, although it might be of interest in other stochastic
    programming applications where nonparametric inference is desired.
